In this lab the objective was to implement two codes for the mergeSort and insertionSort using the mySort() function. The results proved to be sucessful as the given inputs were analyzed and returned in ascending order. This program works efficiently using the mergeSort/insetionSort operator or through a data.txt file.

ANALYSIS: 

___insertionSort.c___

Best case: The equations for best case are: n-1 compartions, 0 swaps since it is the bet case, and n copy operations.
Average case: The equations for the average case are: n-1 comparsions, 0 swaps, and 0 copy operations
Worst case: The equations for the worst case are: (n^2 - n) / 2 compartions, (n^2 - n) / 2 swaps, and n copy operations.
                                                                                                                                                    
___mergeSort.c___

Best case: The equations for the best case are: nlogn for comparsion, 0 swaps, and 2nlogn copy operations.
Average case: The equations for average case are: nlogn for comparsion, 0 swaps, and 2nlogn copy operations
Worst case: The equations for worst case are: nlogn for comparsion, 0 swaps, and 2nlogn copy comparsions
